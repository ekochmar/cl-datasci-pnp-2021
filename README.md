To run the notebooks on your machine, check if `Python 3` is installed. In addition, you will need the following libraries (notebooks tested with the versions indicated in the brackets; for older versions, you may consider running notebooks from https://github.com/ekochmar/cl-datasci-pnp):

- `Pandas` (v 1.0.1) for easy data uploading and manipulation. Check installation instructions at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html
- `Matplotlib` (v 3.1.3): for visualisations. Check installation instructions at https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html
- `NumPy` (v 1.18.1) and `SciPy` (v 1.4.1): for scientific programming. Check installation instruction at https://www.scipy.org/install.html
- `Scikit-learn` (v 0.22.1): for machine learning algorithms. Check installation instructions at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
- `TensorFlow` (v 2; I'm using v 2.2.0): for deep learning algorithms. Check installation instructions at https://www.tensorflow.org/install

Alternatively, a number of these libraries can be installed in one go through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution.
